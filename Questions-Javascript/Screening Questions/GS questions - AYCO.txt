1) Given a number n, return all the prime numbers from n to 1
2) Implement two way binding in Vanilla JS
3) Given an input box with a placeholder value, change the default behaviour so that the placeholder value won't be deleted completely as soon we start typing in the text box. Instead each character should be replaced at a time from the starting of the placeholder value as we start typing. For example, initially the placeholder value is abc@abc.com and we have to input xyz@xyz.com. Then, it should behave like this:
	xbc@abc.com -> xyc@abc.com -> xyz@abc.om -> xyz@xbc.com -> xyz@xyc.com -> xyz@xyz.com
	
4) - There are List of words along with their ranks in some datasource (in-memory) and you need to implement two methods for a search like the one in google search where  when the user type the character sequence, it should fetch all the words matching the character sequence.
 For Ex - In datasource you have – HE (rank=10), HEL (rank=20),  HELL (rank=15),  HELLO (rank=100),  HLOE (rank=25),
And 
User types H then it should match all words HE, HEL, HELL, HELLO, HLOE
User types HE then it should match words HE, HEL, HELL, HELLO
User types HEL then it should match words HEL, HELL, HELLO 
User types HEL then it should match words HEL, HELL, HELLO 
User types HL then it should match words HLOE 
You need to Implement two methods (Functions) :
1. To insert new keywords into the datasource.
2. To search the user entered string with all the possible suggestions in decreasing order of their ranks.

5) – Implement Binary Tree Insertion and Search methods.
